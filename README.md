#My New App

Welcome to My New App, a mobile application designed for connecting lonely souls. This project showcases modern authentication mechanisms, including Google, Kakao, and Line sign-in options, built using Flutter. The app is still in progress. Hopefully, I'll be able to finish it by New Year's

Features
-Multi-platform Authentication: Sign in using Google, Kakao, or Line.
-User Onboarding: Smooth onboarding for new users, with nickname setup and personalized profiles.
-Cross-Platform Compatibility: Developed with Flutter to support both Android and iOS platforms.
